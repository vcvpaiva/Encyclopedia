## Encyclopedia of Deductive Systems

This is a fork of the collaborative and open [Encyclopedia of Proof Systems]().

The goal is to have only some of the systems in the original encyclopedia:

   * NJ, NK (Gentzen-Prawitz style, propositional only)
   * LJ, LK, Maehara-Dragalin, FIL
   * CLL, ILL, one-sided CLL, FILL
   * IK, CK, IS4, CS4, modal cubes (classical and constructive)
   * Barendregt’s cube and Dowek’s `windrose

(maybe even fewer)
